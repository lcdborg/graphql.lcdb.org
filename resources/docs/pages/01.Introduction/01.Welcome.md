# The LDOG Stack for PHP

## Laravel, Doctrine ORM, and GraphQL

This is a template application for building GraphQL applications in
Laravel with Doctrine ORM.  **Known as the LDOG (el-dog) Stack.**

To create a new project run
```
composer create-project api-skeletons/ldog
```

Source code available at https://github.com/api-skeletons/ldog

This site is the ldog project running on Google Cloud.  It includes an example
Doctrine ORM schema and database served as GraphQL.

You may explore the GraphQL with [graphiql](https://ldog.apiskeletons.dev/graphiql)
or POST to this server's GraphQL endpoint at https://ldog.apisketons.dev


## Features

* Dockerfile suitable to immediate deployment to Cloud Run
* docker-compose.yml file - no Laravel Sail integration
* Doctrine ORM configured for XML metadata and no database naming strategy
* Includes the [api-skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql](https://github.com/api-skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql)
  type driver
* The [GraphQLController](https://github.com/API-Skeletons/ldog/blob/main/app/Http/Controllers/GraphQLController.php)
  is pre-configured with example endpoints for connection, entity, and mutation
* The Doctrine [entities](https://github.com/API-Skeletons/ldog/blob/main/app/Doctrine/ORM/Entity/Artist.php)
  have default configuration for [api-skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql](https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql)
* Authorization provided by [api-skeletons/laravel-doctrine-apikey](https://github.com/API-Skeletons/laravel-doctrine-apikey)
  and [laravel/passort](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/passport)
* The Laravel code has been modified so the entire project passes the
  [Doctrine Coding Standard](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-coding-standard/en/11.0/reference/index.html)
* Code quality tools include parallel-lint, phpcs, psalm, and phpunit
* An unit test is included that tests the GraphQL endpoints


## Why use this template application?

This template application is based on Laravel 10.x.  Nothing has been taken away from that
default Laravel release but a lot has been added.

There are many GraphQL solutions available including those that integrate with Laravel
and Eloquent.  But Doctrine ORM is the superior ORM because it is a
[data mapper pattern](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/orm-active-record-vs-data-mapper/).

The [doctrine-orm-graphql](https://github.com/api-skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql) library
creates the types for your Doctrine entities and has numerous other features.

A [Skipper](https://skipper18.com) diagram is included and the example database metadata
is exported from it as XML.  The advantages of XML metadata over annotations or attributes
are many and not needing to edit the XML manually is a big benefit.


## Convert an existing database to GraphQL

Using skipper, import a new external model and import your database.  Change the
Export Data Format to XML and set the path to `~/config/doctrine-orm-metadata`.
Export from Skipper and build your entities.  Turn on `globalEnable` in the driver
and create at least one endpoint.
