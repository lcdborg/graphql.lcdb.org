Security
========

The security of your data is important to us. We have implemented industry standard security
measures to protect your data.

Both API Key and OAuth2 are supported for authentication.

API Key
-------

To test API Key security, POST to https://ldog.apiskeletons.dev/apikey with the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer HkwFkpby6MXJOnpC5QAb1Z4N1o2QmkSsXQPXOkMi0NgTU6Y6zcAgymm5AWJ7GGCV
```

API Key security is implemented with https://github.com/API-Skeletons/laravel-doctrine-apikey
See the documentation for that package for more information.


OAuth2
------

OAuth2 is not configured by default with this project.
If you want to implement Passport, you must use version 11 of [api-skeletongs/doctrine-orm-graphql](https://github.com/API-Skeletons/doctrine-orm-graphql)
