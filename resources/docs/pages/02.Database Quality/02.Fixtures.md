# Fixtures

Included with LDOG is a Laravel Doctrine fixture library.  There are two included fixtures.  To rebuild the
SQLite database, copy `.env.dev` to `.env`, delete the `~/database/database.sqlite` file, and run

```
rm database/database.sqlite
php artisan doctrine:schema:create
php artisan doctrine:data-fixture:import faker
```
